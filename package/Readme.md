# Advanced üí°

You can create your own mixer behaviours by implementing a ``TimelineAnimationMixer`` and overriding the ``OnConnected`` and ``OnUpdate`` methods.

- ``OnConnected`` is called once when the new mixer is injected into the timeline's playable graph. Use it to add inputs to the injected ``AnimationLayerMixerPlayable`` node by calling the extension method ``mixer.AddClip`` and store the output index for blending.

- ``OnUpdate`` is called every frame with a reference to the injected mixer node and manager. Use it to update the weights on 


## Playing animation while Timeline is paused
To play animation while the ``PlayableDirector`` is paused you can call the ``RequireTimelineEvaluate()`` method on ``TimelineGraph Modification Manager`` from the ``OnUpdate`` method of your ``TimelineAnimationMixer``. This will trigger a call to ``Evaluate`` on the ``PlayableDirector`` at the end of the update.
